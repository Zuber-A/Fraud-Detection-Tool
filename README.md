# Fraud-Detection-Tool
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning approach, particularly a Random Forest classifier. The dataset used is highly imbalanced and it simulates the real-world scenario where fraudulent transactions are a small fraction of the total transactions.
Original csv file used to train this program is available for download at www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download. However one may choose to use other files of a similar structure.

Technologies Used:
Python, Scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib

Key Features:
Data preprocessing with pandas.
Data visualization with Matplotlib.
Application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes in the dataset.
Implementation of a Random Forest classifier model.
